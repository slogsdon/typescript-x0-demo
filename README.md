# typescript-x0-demo

> Demo/starter project using TypeScript + React and x0

Featuring:

* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* [x0](https://github.com/c8r/x0)

### Reasoning

This project was primarily created to combine some new technologies in order to see what a more complete project could look like and how the individual parts would work together. Specifics:

* TypeScript: type safe JavaScript code through compile-time checks
* React: type safe interactions via TypeScript
* x0: minimal-config React development environment and static site generator

## Requirements

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/docs/install/) or [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node)

## Getting Started

```
yarn install
yarn start
```

`yarn start` will run x0 in watch mode to rebuild the site on any file change.

## Building for Production

```
yarn build
```

The result can be hosted with your preferred manner.

## Need a Reset?

```
yarn clean
```
