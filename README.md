# typescript-x0-demo

> Demo/starter project using TypeScript + React and x0

Featuring:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [x0](https://github.com/c8r/x0)

### Reasoning

This project was primarily created to combine some new technologies in order to see what a more complete project could look like and how the individual parts would work together. Specifics:

- TypeScript: type safe JavaScript code through compile-time checks
- React: type safe interactions via TypeScript
- x0: minimal-config React development environment and static site generator

## Requirements

- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/docs/install/) or [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node)

## Getting Started
